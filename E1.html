        <p>Elements and the ‘Big Bang’ theory
Our world is made of elements and combinations of elements called compounds. An 
element is a pure substance made of atoms that are all of the same type. At present, 
116 elements are known, and only about 90 of these occur naturally.
During the formation of the universe some 14 billion years ago in the so-called ‘Big 
Bang’, only the lightest elements were formed – hydrogen and helium along with trace amounts of lithium and beryllium. As the cloud of cosmic dust and gases from 
the Big Bang cooled, stars formed, and these then grouped together to form galaxies.
The other 86 elements found in nature were created in nuclear reactions in these stars 
and in huge stellar explosions known as supernovae.</p>

    <p>Elements and our Sun
For most of their lives, stars fuse elemental hydrogen into helium in their cores. Two 
atoms of hydrogen are combined in a series of steps to create helium-4. These 
reactions account for 85% of the Sun’s energy. The remaining 15% comes from 
reactions that produce the elements beryllium and lithium.</p>

    <p>The energy from these nuclear reactions is emitted in various forms of radiation such 
as ultraviolet light, X-rays, visible light, infrared Invisible electromagnetic radiation with 
a wavelength between approximately 0.75 micrometres and 1 millimetre. Infrared 
occurs between the red end of the visible light spectrum and microwaves. All things 
over a certain temperature (absolute zero) absorb and emit infrared radiation. 
Infrared radiation and observing technologies are used in many industries from 
medicine to finding people buried under rubble and by the military and others in 
night-vision goggles. rays, microwaves and radio waves. In addition, energized 
particles such as neutrinos and protons are released, and it is these that make up the 
solar wind.
Earth is in the path of this energy stream, which warms the planet, drives weather and 
provides energy for life. The Earth’s atmosphere is able to screen out most of the harmful radiation, and the Earth’s magnetic field can deflect the harmful effects of 
the solar wind.</p>

    <p>Man-made elements
Only 90 of the 116 known elements occur naturally, so where have the other 26 come 
from? The answer is to be found in the development of nuclear power plants and 
machines known as particle accelerators. Scientists discovered that, by allowing fast 
neutrons to collide with the common isotope of uranium known as U-238 in a nuclear 
reactor, the ‘new’ element plutonium was made by smashing atoms together in 
machines known as particle accelerators, it was discovered that new elements could be made. For example, bombarding atoms of the element curium with atoms of neon 
made element 106 – seaborgium.</p>
